# NixOS System Configurations

This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. 

It's entirely based on [mitchellh/nixos-config](https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config/), with many changes to suit my needs. I suggest checking out his repo before looking at mine.

## How I use it

Untraditionally! I use Windows as the host OS and NixOS within [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
