# NixOS System Configurations

This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. 

It's entirely based on [mitchellh/nixos-config](https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config/), with many changes to suit my needs. I suggest checking out his repo before looking at mine.

## How I use it

I currently have two instances of this config running. One a WSL2 NixOS install and another KVM/Qemu VM under Unraid.
